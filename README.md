# Using Data to Better Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview

This project will focus on finding correlation between successful Kickstarter campaigns. The project will specifically look at data from previous Kickstarter theater campaigns that occurred between 2009 and 2017.

### Purpose

The objective of this of this project is to help provide Louise with the correct data to inform her decision-making process as she decides when time the launch of her Kickstarter campaign. Louise will also need to set a fundraising goal that has proven to be historically obtainable to further bolster the campaign’s probability of success. 

## Analysis and Challenges

To perform my analysis, I used the filter functions in Excel to narrow the scope of the data down to what corresponds with the campaign Louise is interested in starting.  By only looking at campaigns in the “Theater” category I was able to find statistical data that showed the most successful months to launch a Kickstarter campaign.  By filtering further, I was able to determine what goals helped plays have successful campaigns.  Some of the challenges I faced included getting dates of unix format and dividing the category information into a parent and subcategory to provide more specific results.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The corresponding line chart shows a clear trend. Starting campaigns in May and June proved the most successful.  The Fall and Winter months were particularly unsuccessful times to start a fundraising campaign. Based on this data, I would recommend that Louise start her campaign in May as a first option and June as a second option.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

To help Louise establish a fundraising goal that had proven to be historically obtainable, I looked at data specifically in the “Plays” subcategory.  This further narrowed the scope to provide better insight and eliminate more expensive projects that would skew my results.  As seen in the corresponding line chart, plays were most successful when the fundraising goal was kept small.  Most successful plays had a goal of $4,999 or less.  Although there was an above average success rate for projects with goals ranging from $30,000 to $44,999, I would advise Louise to avoid the increased failure risk unless it was absolutely necessary for her project.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Based on percentages, May and June are the most succesful months.
December is by far the worst month to launch a campaign.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

It is best to keep your goal small and reasonable for your specific project category.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

This data is limited to the years 2009 to 2017.  This creates a challenge because many things had drastic changes due to the covid pandemic.  More recent data could help Louise determine if the pandemic affected supporters’ willingness to fund Kickstarter campaigns or plays in general.
Although this data can provide helpful insight, it does not represent less quantifiable attributes.  By mostly focusing the launch dates and fundraising goals, we can quickly lose sight of the uniqueness and quality of specific projects that help garner the support from the public.


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

If I were Louise, I would want to see charts the specifically showed the percentage of successful campaigns based on the launch date.  The chart I was requested to provide shows that May had the most successful campaigns, but that does not account for the overall volume of projects launched in May.  Looking back at the data, we can confirm that May does indeed have the highest percentage of successful projects.   Looking at the provided chart it would be easy to assume that February is not a good month to launch a project.  However, historically February has a fairly high success rate with an smaller volume of projects.
Another chart that would be beneficial to Louise in her decision-making process would be one that showed the success of Kickstarter campaigns based on location. Louise has plans to launch campaigns in different countries and it would be helpful to know how much funding and timing varies based on locale.
